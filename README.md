Welcome to my Dotfiles.

# VIM

  I use [neovim](https://neovim.io/), so they're might be a few things in my
  [.vimrc](/adc613/Dotfiles/blob/master/init.vim) that aren't compatible with
  vanilla VIM. Also my .vimrc is named init.vim.

  I made my [init.vim](/adc613/Dotfiles/blob/master/init.vim) file modular,
  maybe too module. A lot of the configuration lives in the [configs/](/adc613/Dotfiles/tree/master/config)

# Install scripts [installs/](/adc613/Dotfiles/tree/master/installs)

  I try to write install scripts for some of my favorite Linux tools. These
  files may not be up to date. Proceed with caution.

# Vanilla settings (deprecated) [vanilla_settings/](/adc613/Dotfiles/tree/master/vanilla_settings)
  
  Basic settings that don't rely on plugins, useful for quickly setting up a
  new server, but I haven't updated or use them in a long time.
